            Building and maintaining a portfolio site has always been at the absolute bottom of my list of things I&apos;m excited to spend time on. But... there‚Äôs this new thing ‚Äî I dunno if you‚Äôve heard of it ‚Äî it‚Äôs called AI, and it‚Äôs kind of revolutionizing software development. üòè
          </p>
          <p>
            So this site is a bit of an experiment. It&apos;s the product of AI-assisted software development (distinctly different from ‚Äúvibe coding‚Äù). I&apos;ve open-sourced the whole thing too, for anyone who wants a nifty little portfolio site to tinker with. Go ahead, take a peek under the hood. Heck, open an issue and tell me what I did wrong ‚Äî or better yet, just make a PR and fix it!

            David is a software architect with a designer&apos;s mindset and a builder&apos;s instinct. He specializes in designing complex, data-driven experiences that feel intuitive and efficient ‚Äî especially in areas where the stakes are high, the logic is deep, and the edge cases matter.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            His work blends product strategy, UX architecture, and hands-on design execution. He&apos;s led cross-functional teams, built new products from the ground up, and helped scale existing systems without losing sight of the end user. Whether he&apos;s modeling data relationships, designing interactive tools, or thinking through complex data models, he cares about clarity, precision, and momentum. He&apos;s worked across domains ‚Äî from compensation planning to surf forecasting to game design ‚Äî and brings a sharp eye to both product mechanics and user experience.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Outside of work, he&apos;s a husband, a dad, a surfer, a skier, and an incurable tinkerer. He likes to build things ‚Äî digital and physical ‚Äî and is usually chasing a better system, a smoother flow, or a smarter solution. If he&apos;s not sketching out a product idea, he&apos;s probably in the ocean or working on a side project with his daughter.
