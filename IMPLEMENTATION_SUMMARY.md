```markdown
!video[Alt text or description](https://video-url.mp4)
```

### Architecture Flow

```

    ↓
File Selection
    ↓
Upload to /api/admin/upload-video
    ↓
Supabase Storage (media/selected-works-videos/)
    ↓
Return Public URL
    ↓
Generate Markdown (!video[alt](url))
    ↓
Copy to Clipboard
    ↓
User Pastes in Editor
    ↓
Content Saved
    ↓
Content Rendered (parseContentWithVideos)
    ↓
VideoPlayer Component (Video.js)
    ↓
User Views & Plays Video
```

### Storage Structure
```
Supabase Storage
└── media/
    ├── selected-works/          (existing images)
    └── selected-works-videos/    (new videos)
        ├── 1234567890-abc123.mp4
        ├── 1234567891-def456.webm
        └── ...
```

### File Naming Convention
```
{timestamp}-{random-string}.{extension}
```
Example: `1730000000-x8k2p9q.mp4`

- Matroska (`.mkv`)
- MPEG (`.mpeg`, `.mpg`)
- 3GP (`.3gp`)
- FLV (`.flv`)

   - Preload hints
   - Adaptive bitrate streaming

6. **Management**
   - Video library/browser
   - Bulk upload
   - Video analytics
   - Storage usage tracking

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables Required
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
```

### Supabase Configuration
1. Ensure `media` bucket exists
2. Verify public access for `media` bucket
3. Check storage quotas
4. Confirm CORS settings if needed

### Post-Deployment Testing
1. Test video upload
2. Verify Supabase storage
3. Check video playback
4. Test on mobile devices
5. Verify different video formats

## Documentation

Three comprehensive documents created:

1. **VIDEO_EMBED_FEATURE.md** - User guide and technical docs
2. **TEST_VIDEO_FEATURE.md** - Complete testing checklist
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This implementation overview
